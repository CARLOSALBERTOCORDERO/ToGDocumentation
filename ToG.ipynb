The last years many amazing achievements in detection and classification when using large Neural Networks CNN and GPUs.\n","Every year, many contest related with satellite images classification are performed. One example of this kind of contest is “ImageNet” and using CNN has dominated the contest. Many works have done on Deep Learning the progress obtained is huge, although the achievements obtained using satellite images is imitated and the reason is the difficulty to process such images efficiently with CNNs. To maintain the processing reasonable the image are imitated to 299x299. We can consider that the main reason of the scarce results is the lack of labeled datasets."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"voq1Zyycq7V3","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Training data\n","\n","The Database that is going to be used in this experiment is the one provided by IARPA Functional Map of the World (fMoW)1. This database has two formats. The full version that contain four or in some cases eight layers. Those images that belong to the full dataset are in TIFF format and all together are close to three and a half terabyte. There is another format compacted in RGB and that has the classical (Red, Green and Blue) layers. This second database is the one that is going to be used. This database is already separated in Training, Test, and Sequences. For this experiment, just Training and Test databases are going to be considered. As mentioned in previous experiments[2] this database will be cropped using the bounding box and all the images with cloud levels bigger than forty percent or images smaller than 5 pixels will be removed."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Fqlod0COuZ6C","colab_type":"code","outputId":"168237b4-8ae1-4a26-bef5-95553900f0f9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1573003032804,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":391,"user":{"displayName":"CARLOS ALBERTO CORDERO ROBLES","photoUrl":"","userId":"08062883036271595771"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34}},"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/gdrive')"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/gdrive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/gdrive\", force_remount=True).\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
